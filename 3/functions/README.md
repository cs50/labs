# Functions, Arguments

Recall that `print` is a "function" that's built into Python. Someone implemented that function long ago so that you don't need to worry about how to print something on the screen; you just know that you can do it.

Of course, that someone had no idea what you (or anyone) might want to print on the screen, and so print accepts one or more "arguments," inputs that tell it what, exactly, to print.

In `print.py` in the text editor at top-right, write a program that prints anything other than `hello, world`.

Recall that you can run (and therefore test) your program by executing (i.e., running) 

```
python3 print.py
```

in the terminal window at bottom-right.

{% next %}
